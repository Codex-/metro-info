> ðŸšŒ Simplified interaction with Christchurch's Metro Info bus service

## Install

```
npm install metro-info
```

## Usage

Getting times for a specific Platform can be achieved as per the example below.

```typescript
import { getPlatformTimes, PlatformTimes } from 'metro-info';

async function getTimes(): void {
  const platformTimes: PlatformTimes = await getPlatformTimes(1205);
}
```

If you're unsure of a Platform number, they can be found on the physical stops themselves or alternatively a complete collection of all Platforms with their locations, tags, and various other information can be obtained as per the example below.

```typescript
import { getPlatformLocations, PlatformLocations } from 'metro-info';

async function getLocations(): void {
  const platformLocations: PlatformLocations = await getPlatformLocations();
}
```

## Models

The models closely resemble those as exposed by the Connexionz API. The schema documentation was incredibly verbose, I have omitted commenting many items as a lot of the schema documentation simply reiterated the property name.

## Issues

If you encounter a case where an exception is thrown while parsing the XML response, please raise an issue including the XML that caused the failure and I will investigate the cause.

## TODO

- Testing of the mappers.
- Explore other schema types to expose from the official MetroInfo API.
